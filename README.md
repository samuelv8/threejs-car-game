This template is designed for deploying a Three.js project written in TypeScript in less than a minute.

It comes with examples for everything needed to create a basic scene including:
* Renderer
* Window resizer
* Camera
* Lights
* OrbitControls
* Assets: (basic shapes like a cube & `.glb` models)
* Textures

# Commands

* `npm install` - installs the project
* `npm run build` - builds the project, which is output to `dist/bundle.js` by default
* `npm start` - starts the server on `http://localhost:9000` by default
