[Click here to view a live demo of the deployed template](https://winstoncooke.github.io/threejs-typescript-template/)

This template is designed for deploying a Three.js project written in TypeScript in less than a minute.

It comes with examples for everything needed to create a basic scene including:

- Renderer
- Window resizer
- Camera
- Lights
- OrbitControls
- Assets: basic shapes like a cube & `.glb` models
- Model loader
- Textures
- Animation support (delta synced with the clock for consistent framerates)

## Commands

- `npm install` - installs the project
- `npm run build` - builds the project, which is output to `dist/bundle.js` by default
- `npm start` - starts the server on `http://localhost:9000` by default
